## 1. Find 20 pieces of NTAG

```
NTAG: NFC tags/stickers are passive devices, which means that they operate without a power supply of their own and are reliant on an active device to come into range before they are activated. These devices canâ€™t really do any processing of their own, instead they are simply used to transfer information to an active device, such as a smartphone. 
```

If you prefer to run Budgie Music Kit with the physical blocks, you will need NFC stickers. You can find them from your local or online robotic/electronic store. 

To reference, I share the Amazon Search with "NFC Stickers" screenshot:

## 2. Write pre-defined text to NFC-stickers with an NFC Utilization tool

When you download "Budgie" to your NFC-supported device, the app can recognize the NFC-stickers. But, first you need to write the following pre-defined text with an NFC-Utilization Tool. I am using [NFC Tools](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wakdev.wdnfc) in my phone, you can pick your favorite app from your phone's marketplace.

The tags should be written with the following texts:

```
Block Name = NFC Text
----------   --------

* START = "start";
* LOOP = "loop";
* ADD_NOTE_A = "notea";
* ADD_NOTE_B = "noteb";
* ADD_NOTE_C = "notec";
* ADD_NOTE_D = "noted";
* ADD_NOTE_E = "notee";
* ADD_NOTE_F = "notef";
* ADD_NOTE_G = "noteg";
* ADD_NOTE_NULL = "notenull";
* LOW_FREQ = "freqlow";
* HIGH_FREQ = "freqhigh";
* BPM = "bpm";
* MEASURE = "measure";
* KICK = "kick";
* GUITAR_SOUND = "guitar";
* PIANO_SOUND = "piano";
* SINE_WAVE = "sinewave";
* SQUARE_WAVE = "squarewave";
* RUN = "run";
* SPEAK = "info";
* SAVE = "save";

```

## 3. Prepare your blocks with your favorite material

We shared the 3D Print and Laser-Cut models in our Drive Folder: [Tangible Kit - 3D Design Files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QtAqzIGH1LJofvgtrSxLd6jc1V5ipldE?usp=sharing) If you are not familiar with these technologies, you can simply use any carboard or play-dough to model the shapes and place the NFC in them. You can simply see our web demo to check the shapes or be creative and make your own shapes!

## 4. Download Budgie App

Budgie app is only available for Android phones (for now.) You can download the app from: [Google Play Store - Budgie Music Programming](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alpay.twinmusic&hl=en)


## 5. Start Coding

Tap the START block with your device and start coding! You can follow our [Tutorials](https://budgi.es/tutorial.html) to learn more about music and programming.
