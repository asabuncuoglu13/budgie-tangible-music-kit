                    Programming education is now a part of the secondary school curriculum in many countries. This quick
                    change brought inequalities for most of the students. Many public schools have not a decent
                    infrastructure such as computers or internet connections to run programming activities.
                    Additionally, the current curriculum for programming education does not include inclusive
                    activities. Most programming activities consist of drawings, animations, and visuals as the outputs
                    of programming activities.
                    <br><br>
                    We designed <i>"Budgie Programming Kit"</i> for the students with mixed visual abilities. To make it
                    reachable for most of the community, we used inexpensive materials and open-sourced our code. We
                    tested the prototype with students from YGA Summer Camp. We completed this prototype only one hour
                    before the workshop, and it was beyond our expectations. It was a very educational and inspiring
                    process, yet it was the first time we teach to blind children. Their excitement to try a new product
                    encouraged us to move this project further.
