# Development Process of Budgie

I would like to start with the story behind Budgie. Budgie is my first project in Twin Science and Robotics Company. The project is the reason why I started to work with them. We were already met with Twin as we are already working in the educational technology area. In Turkey, we do not have so many companies that produce innovative products. Although the company is 2 years old, its impact is wide. These reasons of the wide impact can be summarized with their starting point, their aim was not creating a product that earns a lot of money, they were a team of volunteers that wants to spread the joy of science alongside Turkey. They were conducting experiments about physics but using Arduino or similar development boards to introduce technology to disadvantageous children. Later on, they decided to produce Turkey's first made electronic development kit to better introduce science.

I met with the company when they did produce their prototype. But, we couldn't have the chance to work together, as at that time both of us do not decide on what's next. One night in July, we gathered to discuss our progress and eat some noodles. In this meeting, we talked about their next workshop with visually impaired children. As I was already working on developing programming environments with low-cost materials and shared smartphones, I had the idea of developing a music kit for visually impaired children. We had three weeks to develop the app and coding system, design the blocks and prepare an appropriate program for the workshop.

To construct our development kit, we needed to answer the following questions:

1. How do students interact with the blocks?
2. How can we keep the affordability of the product while making inclusive for different needs?
3. How do early ages can use the kit with ease?

So, I have started the development process with learning music. I knew nothing about the notation, technical terms or any related information about composing a piece of music. The last time, I have been learning technical terms about music was primary school 2nd grade and we were learning how to play the flute... I learned some pieces of music playing the Tone.js library. But, after the prototype, updating the code of Tone.js gives me some struggles. Tone.js is a great library to create highly functional musical coding, however, it is not very suitable for the ones who are not familiar with the music. Meanwhile, I was already working with p5.js a Javascript library that allows developers to easily construct their creative works on the browser. So, I decided to take a quick look at p5.sound library. The library has probably fewer features than Tone.js, but it was enough for our project.



# Notes:

Our aim in this project is not to comprehend all concepts in the programming. Of course, we are developing the product to support more features and we would like to hear your ideas about improving the product, but as these children already facing some difficulties, we wanted to encourage them to meet with technology and ask a question about technology. We want them to ask "What is an algorithm?", "How do these blocks work?", "What are the other ways to create algorithms or making some music?" or "What are the other programming environments we can code?".
