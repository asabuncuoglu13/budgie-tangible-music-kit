                Programming education is now a part of secondary school curriculum in many countries.This quick
                change brought the inequalities for most of the students.Many of the public schools have no
                infrastructure or decent internet connection to run the programming activities. <br><br> Additionally, we do
                not have an inclusive curriculum. Most of the programming activities include drawings, animations and
                visuals as the outputs of programming activities. So, we decided to design a programming kit for blinds
                on July 2019. <br><br> To make it reachable for the most of the community, the kit should be inclusive and
                affordable at the same time.We aimed to finish the first prototype in two weeks to see it in action in a
                previously planned workshop.We completed the first prototype only one hour before the workshop and it was
                beyond our expectations. It was a very educational and inspiring process yet it was the first time we
                teach to blind children. Their excitement to try a new product encouraged us to move this project
                further.
